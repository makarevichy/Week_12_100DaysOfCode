# Week 12

### Day 78-80: August 5-7, 3 days.

**Today's Progress**: R and API.

**Thoughts** 
- I was very interested in the topic of code execution in R via API. After all, it is very important that third-party developers have access to the models of machine learning built by you. I am studying a great [plumber package](https://www.rplumber.io/) that helps a lot with this.
